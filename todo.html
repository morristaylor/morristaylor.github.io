    <p>Hello again. This is a todo list. It is v1. h/t to Treehouse, Jon Duckett, Gordon Zhu, and /r/LearnJavaScript for the reference and teaching material.
    <p>Issues: I tried to work localStorage into the added todo items, but was running into issues moving items in and out of the todos array inside of the todoList object. I wanted to show I had at least a working understanding of key/value pairs, JSON, and local/session storage, so I used an easier-to-me "howdy" message  that takes your name submitted via form and displays it. I left several failed attempts commented out in my code, too. I want to keep working on this, but also want to get it submitted.
    <p>The button/input combo talks to a handlers object, which uses addTodo() to add todos to the array, then display todos to the page. I tried to work this combo into a form submission (like the name input form) so enter/return could be used instead of clicking the button, but each time it was submitted, the page cleared. Working on figuring that one out-- considering using keyup on enter as a workaround.
    <p>HTML and CSS were built and designed to have a similar look and feel to my homepage. I also just like tomato.
    <p>Excited to start classes next week.
